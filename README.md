# README

This is a fork of [Aldo Cortesi](https://github.com/cortesi)'s
[`scurve`](https://github.com/cortesi/scurve) module for drawing space-filling
curves like the Hilbert Curve.

My addition to this project is `dexvis`, a tool specifically designed to
visualise Android Dalvik Executable (DEX) files, using multiple different
visualisation methods, including the ones supported by `binvis`, a tool
included in `scurve`.

The original README file, as authored by Cortesi, may be found
[here](https://github.com/debayande/scurve/blob/master/README.orig.md).
